# Wag N Walk
</br>
### A Full-Service Dog Walking Application
</br>
Wag N Walk's primary goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for dog walkers to provide quality services to dog owners.
</br></br>
Wag N Walk allows users to register as a dog walker and/or a dog owner.

Walkers have the ability to create walk schedules and are then made available to owners in their area.

</br></br>
Alternatively, owners create their own personal profile and then a profile for each of their dogs to be shared with the walkers who they are assigned to.
